\# Ready Or Not SDK Dump Guide



This folder is reserved for local SDK dumps generated with \*\*Dumper7\*\*.  

The contents of this folder are intentionally ignored by Git (only this README is tracked).



---



\## Requirements

\- \[Dumper7](https://github.com/Encryqed/Dumper-7) (latest release)

\- Ready Or Not installed and updated (Steam version recommended)

\- A working injector (Xenos, Process Hacker, or any preferred injector)



---



\## Quick Steps



1\. \*\*Download Dumper7\*\*

&nbsp;  - Grab the latest release from the official GitHub repo.

&nbsp;  - Extract the files somewhere easy to reach (e.g., Desktop).



2\. \*\*Launch Ready Or Not\*\*

&nbsp;  - Start the game and wait until you’re in the main menu.



3\. \*\*Inject Dumper7\*\*

&nbsp;  - Use your injector to inject `Dumper-7.dll` into the `ReadyOrNot-Win64-Shipping.exe` process.



4\. \*\*Wait for Dump\*\*

&nbsp;  - Dumper7 will automatically generate the SDK dump.

&nbsp;  - Look for a new folder in your chosen dump directory (usually `C drive`).



5\. \*\*Copy SDK Here\*\*

&nbsp;  - Take the generated SDK dump and copy/paste it into this `ReadyornotSDK` folder.

&nbsp;  - This keeps all dumps organized locally (but not pushed to Git).



---



\## Notes

\- If the game updates, you should re-dump the SDK to stay in sync.

\- Only the folder structure is tracked in Git — \*\*all SDK files stay local\*\*.

\- For safety, avoid sharing dumped SDKs publicly.
